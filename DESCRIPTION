Description: The parametric approach uses a nonlinear mixed effects model, which estimates model parameters and inflection points at the same time. The inflection points treat as random effects, which 
             can be estimated using the best linear unbiased predictors. The multi-stage nonparametric approach is designed to estimate individual longitudinal trajectories and 
             and their inflection points iteratively. To do this, we develop an iterative algorithm.
