Description: The parametric approach uses a nonlinear mixed effects model, where estimates model parameters at the same time. The inflection point has an random effect, which is 
             estimated by the best linear unbiased predictors. The multi-stage nonparametric approach uses an iterative algorithm, which has an estimating individual longitudinal trajectories step and 
             and an estimating individual inflection points step. Two steps are dependent and estimate those estimates alternately until convergence criterion is satistfied.
