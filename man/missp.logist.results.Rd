\arguments{
\item{nsim}{number of simulation runs.}

\item{n}{number of sample size.}

\item{res}{a nsim-length of list for simulation results.}

\item{time.length}{number of data points at which predictors are required for each individual longitudinal trajectory. This time point for graphs to be plotted.}

\item{beta}{a (p-1)-length of true coefficient vector corresponding to subject specific covariates.}

\item{beta0}{true intercept of the log-normal model for the inflection point.}

\item{file}{a character string of file name for a creating plot in .eps file extention.}
}
\value{
A list of the summarized simulation results including
\itemize{
       \item{res.table}{a data frame of the absolute biases, estimated standard deviations, average of the estimated standard errors and 95\% coverage probabilities for the fixed effects (\code{beta0}, \code{beta}).}
       \item{Rel.glob.logT.est}{a data frame of the relative average performance of inflection points for all subjects including the relative absolute biases, the relative empirical standard errors, the relative bootstrap standard deviations and 95\% boostrap confidence intervals.}
